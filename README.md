# SPIFlashMemory
Arduino code for SPI Flash Memory


The original tutorial and code are by Catoblepas of Instructables.com

(Tutorial PDF is added on the repository for reference)

I have modified the code so that I can send a simple string and readback a simple string, hiding all the ascii encoding and hexa world
